### What I learned

- Don't leave any "[Broken Windows](https://medium.com/@learnstuff.io/broken-window-theory-in-software-development-bef627a1ce99)" so to speak (I.E. tackle ALL edge cases for the best user experience!)
- Introducted to JavaScript and connecting it to DOM elements to behave as described (already familiar with OOP in C#/C++)
