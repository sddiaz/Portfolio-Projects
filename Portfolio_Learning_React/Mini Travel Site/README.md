# React Project #2: Mini Travel Site
Another tiny, more basic project, but a great introduction to props and reading props from a data source. Also included a few unique touches that the course did not require of us, including a hidden dark mode button, custom scroll bar, and more. 

**Challenges:**
- Keeping track of importing the proper items
- Implementing proper data access. 

**Lessons Learned:**
- Practiced and improved working with complex file structures (components folder, utilizing App.js & Index.js, etc.)
- Gained knowledge and implementation ability for props, spread operator, accessing properties, etc.
