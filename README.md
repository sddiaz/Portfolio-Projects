A series of in-progress personal projects I've done for fun:  
/ -------------------- /  
**Calculator**:  
Details:  
For this app, I followed no online step-by-step tutorials on design, logic etc. There was one instance (implementing the dark mode button) in which I researched the best way to do something, but otherwise this is solely from scratch. My first real project, and first time designing a UI 
based on a static illustration (bringing it to life.. per se).
