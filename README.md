# Portfolio-Projects
(A personal portfolio website will be up once I have 5-10 projects finished) 
A series of in-progress _personal_ projects I've done to increase my knowledge of software development.  
(Many more work-related projects have been completed, these are solely the personal ones).

## **Skills Utilized: C#, XAML, WPF**  
Details:  
For this app, I followed no online step-by-step tutorials on design, logic etc. This is solely from scratch. My first ever personal project, and first time designing a UI based on a static illustration (bringing it to life.. per se).

## **Clippit**: Clipboard web app

## **Skills Utilized: Microsoft SQL, HTML, CSS, C#**  
Details:   
The idea of this application is to paste in your desired info on one device, generate your code, enter the code on another device and retrieve your info back! This way, you don't need to email yourself, Teams message yourself, etc, like many people often do. It can be used from any device via a web browser. The goal here was to implement a database, and make the UI look appealing (albeit simple) as well!

## **Passified: Password Generator web app (in progress)**  
## **Skills Utilized: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
Details:  
This simple password generator is nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times, so my goal is to make the UI experience the focal point. Plenty of moving parts and things that are nice to look at. I'll also include links to the top password storage / management systems so the user has some quick tools for their new password.
