# Portfolio-Projects   
A series of in-progress _personal_ projects I've done to increase my knowledge of software development.  
(Many more work-related projects have been completed, these are solely the personal ones).  
(A personal portfolio website will be up once I have 5-10 projects finished)

Details:  
This simple password generator is nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times, so my goal was to make the UI experience the focal point. This was my first time really focusing on creating a pleasant UI, and I think I got the job done. Plenty of moving parts and things that are nice to look at. I included custom switches, a reactive slider, plenty of hover effects, an infinite carousel, and more. I learned a ton this project, mostly about organizing projects and working on creating clean code.

## **Skills Utilized: Microsoft SQL, HTML, CSS, C#**  
Details:   
The idea of this application web-based message retrieval. It can be used from any device via a web browser. The goal here was to implement a database, and make the UI look appealing (albeit simple) as well! Once again, small and simple, with greater things to come.

Details:  
The infamous calculator project. Simple, small, but what I believe to be just humble beginnings. Not much else to it. Dark mode and some extra flashiness for brownie points.
